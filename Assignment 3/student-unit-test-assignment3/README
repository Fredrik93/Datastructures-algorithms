This is the unit test for assignment 2.

To run the tests you need to do the following:

1. Extract the contents of the zip archive to a folder. They should include:
   * RPNTest.class
   * unit-test-rpn.sh
   * SinglyLinkedListTest.class
   * unit-test-singlylinkedlist.sh
   * TreeTest.class
   * unit-test-tree.sh
   * hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
   * junit-4.12.jar
   * This README file (funny bootstrap problem)

2. Place your RPN.java, SinglyLinkedList.java, Tree.java in the same folder where zipped content was unpacked.

(WINDOWS)
3.a Run the test using the powershell started in the same folder (without the `)
  If you are running a windows machine, compile with (without the `)
  `javac -cp . RPN.java`
  `javac -cp . SinglyLinkedList.java`
  `javac -cp . Tree.java`
  and execute with (without the ` but keep ')
  `java -cp '.;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;junit-4.12.jar' org.junit.runner.JUnitCore RPNTest`
  `java -cp '.;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;junit-4.12.jar' org.junit.runner.JUnitCore SinglyLinkedListTest`
  `java -cp '.;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;junit-4.12.jar' org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TreeTest`

  Note: To open the power shell in windows, hold shift and right click in the folder and pick 'Open powershell window here'

4.a If you need to rerun the test, update the source code files in the folder and simply redo the commands in step 3.a



(MacOS & Unix)
3.b Make the script executable by running (without the `)
  `chmod +x *.sh`
  alternatively if you need privileges (unlikely)
  `sudo chmod + *.sh`
  
4.b Run the test using the script (Mac and Linux users) in the terminal started in the same folder (without the `)
  `./unit-test-rpn.sh`
  `./unit-test-singlylinkedlist.sh`
  `./unit-test-tree.sh`

  Note: To open a terminal in the folder, right click in the folder and pick 'Open in terminal'

5.b If you need to rerun the test, simply update the source code files and run the commands in step 4.b



If you are having trouble executing the unit testing, consult the discussion forum on Canvas.

(Troubleshooting)
Make sure that you are running latest JDK and JRE to ensure compatibility.
The unit test was compiled with openjdk-11


Windows users: 
Make sure that you can access the java binaries through the command prompt/powershell
